# RouOutliner

Simplicity is the best.
RouOutliner, a plain text outliner with only three features.
Outliner, Table and Checklist.
To Organize, to Clarify and to Action.

* Why create this outliner?
    * I ([@Roulesophy](http://twitter.com/roulesophy)) am a Drafts4 and OmniOutliner heavy user in iOS.
    * I created some script in Drafts4's for outlining
    * Sometimes I am not using iPad I also need to do outlining
    * I really missed those functions I developed!
    * Therefore, RouOutliner is out :)
* Why plain text?
    * Plain text is the content which can stay for longest time
        * Needs specific program to open proprietary format
        * What if we cannot use them?
    * It is better to do version control

    * Organising your idea:
        * Type all random thinkings in your mind here
        * Use our indend function to make hierarcy
        * Use our reordering function to create sequence
    * Use table to make your idea clear
    * Convert the idea to action
            * Insert todo for points needed
